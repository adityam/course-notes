    "text": "1.2 Key simplifying idea\nIn the stochastic optimization problems considered above, the decision maker does not observe any data before making a decision. In many situations, the decision maker does observe some data, which is captured by the following model. Suppose a decision maker observes a random variable \\(S \\in \\ALPHABET S\\) and then chooses an action \\(A \\in \\ALPHABET A\\) as a function of his observation according to a decision rule \\(π\\), i.e., \\[ A = π(S). \\]\nUpon choosing the action \\(A\\), the decision maker incurs a cost \\(c(S,A,W)\\), where \\(W \\in \\ALPHABET W\\) is a random variable. We assume that the primitive random variables \\((S,W)\\) are defined on a common probability space and have a known joint distribution. Assume that the decision maker is risk neutral and, therefore, wants to minimize \\(\\EXP[ c(S, π(S), W)]\\), where the expectation is taken with respect to the joint probability distribution of \\((S,W)\\).\nFormally, the above optimization problem may be written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:obs} \\tag{P1}\n  \\min_{π \\colon \\ALPHABET S \\to \\ALPHABET A} \\EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ].\n\\end{equation}\\]\nDefine \\(J(π) = \\EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ]\\). Then, Problem \\eqref{eq:obs} is conceptually the same as Problem \\eqref{eq:basic} with one difference: In Problem \\eqref{eq:basic}, the minimization is over a parameter \\(a\\), while in Problem \\eqref{eq:obs}, the minimization is over a function \\(π\\).\nWhen \\(\\ALPHABET S\\) and \\(\\ALPHABET A\\) are finite sets, the optimal policy can be obtained by an exhaustive search over all policies as follows: for each policy \\(π\\) compute the performance \\(J(π)\\) and then pick the policy \\(π\\) with the smallest expected cost.\nSuch an exhaustive search is not satisfying for two reasons. First, it has a high computational cost. There are \\(| \\ALPHABET A |^{| \\ALPHABET S |}\\) policies and, for each policy, we have to evaluate an expectation, which can be expensive. Second, the above enumeration procedure does not work when \\(\\ALPHABET S\\) or \\(\\ALPHABET A\\) are continuous sets.\nThere is an alternative way of viewing the problem that simplifies it considerably. Instead of viewing the optimization problem before the system starts running (i.e., the ex ante view), imagine that the decision maker waits until they see the realization \\(s\\) of \\(S\\) (i.e., the interim view). they then asks what action \\(a\\) should they take to minimize the expected conditional cost \\(Q(s,a) := \\EXP[ c(s,a, W) | S = s]\\), i.e., they consider the problem\n\\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:cond-1} \\tag{P2}\n  \\min_{a \\in \\ALPHABET A} \\EXP[ c(s,a,W) | S = s], \\quad\n  \\forall s \\in \\ALPHABET S.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThus, Problem \\eqref{eq:obs}, which is a functional optimization problem, has been reduced to a collection of parameter optimization problems (Problem \\eqref{eq:cond-1}), one for each possible of \\(s\\).\nNow define \\[ \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:cond} \\tag{P2-policy}\n  π^∘(s) = \\arg \\min_{a \\in \\ALPHABET A} \\EXP[ c(s,a, W) | S = s]\n\\end{equation} \\] where ties (in the minimization) are broken arbitrarily.\n\nTheorem 1.1 The decision rule \\(π^∘\\) defined in \\eqref{eq:cond} is optimal for Problem \\ref{eq:basic}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark\n\n\n\nWe restricted the proof finite \\(\\ALPHABET S\\), \\(\\ALPHABET A\\), \\(\\ALPHABET W\\). This is to avoid any measurability issues. If \\(\\ALPHABET S\\) and \\(\\ALPHABET A\\) are continuous sets, we need to restrict to measurable \\(π\\) in Problem \\ref{eq:basic} (otherwise the expectation is not well defined; of course the cost \\(c\\) also has to be measurable). However, it is not immediately obvious that \\(π^∘\\) defined in \\eqref{eq:cond} is measurable. Conditions that ensure this are known as measurable selection theorems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(π\\) be any other decision rule. Then, \\[ \\begin{align*}\n  \\EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ] &\\stackrel{(a)}= \\EXP[ \\EXP[c(S, π(S), W) | S ] ] \\\\\n  &\\stackrel{(b)}\\ge \\EXP[\\EXP[ c(S, π^∘(S), W) | S ] ] \\\\\n  &\\stackrel{(c)}= \\EXP[ c(S, π^∘(S), W) ],\n\\end{align*} \\] where \\((a)\\) and \\((c)\\) follow from the law of iterated expectations and \\((b)\\) follows from the definition of \\(π^∘\\) in \\eqref{eq:cond}.\n\n\n\nWe can also provide a partial converse of Theorem 1.1.\n\nTheorem 1.2 If \\(\\PR(S = s) > 0\\) for all \\(s\\), then any optimal policy \\(π^∘\\) for Problem \\(\\ref{eq:basic}\\) must satisfy \\(\\eqref{eq:cond}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\n\n\nWe prove this by contradiction. Suppose \\(π^*\\) is an optimal policy that does not satisfy \\eqref{eq:cond}. By definition of \\(π^∘\\), it must be the case that for all states \\[\\begin{equation}\n   \\EXP[ c(s, π^∘(s), W) | S = s ]\n   \\le\n   \\EXP[ c(s, π^*(s), W) | S = s ] .\n   \\label{eq:ineq:1}\n\\end{equation}\\] Now, since \\(π^*\\) does not satisfy \\eqref{eq:cond}, there exists some state \\(s^∘ \\in \\ALPHABET S\\) such that \\[\\begin{equation}\n   \\EXP[ c(s^∘, π^*(s^∘), W) | S = s^∘ ]\n   >\n   \\EXP[ c(s^∘, π^∘(s^∘), W) | S = s^∘ ] .\n   \\label{eq:ineq:2}\n\\end{equation}\\] Therefore, \\[\\begin{align*}\n   \\EXP[ c(S, π^*(S), W) ]\n   &=\n   \\sum_{s \\in \\ALPHABET S} \\PR(S = s)\n   \\EXP[ \\EXP[ c(s, π^*(s), W) | S = s ] ]\n   \\\\\n   & \\stackrel{(a)}>\n   \\sum_{s \\in \\ALPHABET S} \\PR(S = s)\n   \\EXP[ \\EXP[ c(s, π^∘(s), W) | S = s ] ]\n   \\\\\n   &=\n   \\EXP[ c(S, π^∘(S), W) ]\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\((a)\\) follows from \\eqref{eq:ineq:1} and \\eqref{eq:ineq:2} and the inequality is strict becase \\(\\PR(S = s^∘) > 0\\). Thus, \\(J(π^*) > J(π^∘)\\) and, hence, \\(π^*\\) cannot be an optimal policy."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image credit: https://americangallery.wordpress.com/category/cafferty-james-h/\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe newsvendor problem is a simple model of stochastic optimization problem where a decision has to be made when there is uncertainty about the outcome. It also shows that for some stochastic optimization problems it is possible to obtain the qualitative properties of the nature of optimal solution.\n\nEach morning, a newsvendor has to decide how many newspapers to buy before knowing the demand during the day. The newsvendor purchases a newspaper at a cost of \\(\\$p\\) per newspaper and sells them at a cost of \\(\\$q\\) per newspaper, where \\(q > p\\). Any unsold newspapers at the end of the day have no salvage value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Reward as a function of \\(w\\) for a fixed value of \\(a\\). You can change the values of \\(p\\) and \\(a\\) by moving the sliders. Here \\(q = 1\\).\n\n\nLet \\(a\\) denote the number of newspapers bought and \\(W\\) denotes the demand. If \\(W < a\\), then the newsvendor will sell \\(W\\) newspapers and receive a total earnings of \\(q W - p a\\). If \\(W \\ge a\\), then the newsvendor will sell \\(a\\) newspapers and receive a total earning of \\(q a - p a\\). Thus, the reward is \\(r(a,W)\\), where\n\\[r(a, w) = \\begin{cases}\n   q w - p a, & \\text{if } w < a, \\\\\n   q a - p a, & \\text{if } w \\ge a.\n\\end{cases} \\]\n\n\nThe problem above has discrete action and discrete demand. To build intuition, we first consider the case where both the actions and demand are continuous. Let \\(f(w)\\) denote the probability density of the demand and \\(F(w)\\) denote the cumulative probability density. Then, the expected reward is \\[ \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:J}\nJ(a) = \\int_{0}^a [ q w - p a ] f(w) dw + \\int_{a}^\\infty [ q a - p a ] f(w) dw.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nAs an illustration, for a particular distribution (see the later plot for exact choice of parameters), we can plot the performance as a function of action, and identify its maximma as shown in the plot below/on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 The value of expected cost as a function of action. The blue dot shows the value of action chosen in Figure 2. The red dot shows the optimal value.\n\n\nThe action with respect to the probability distribution and the corresponding reward function are illustrated in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 The value of expected cost as a function of action. In the first plot, the blue shaded region represents the probability of getting a demand less than the ordered goods and the red shared region represents the probability of getting a demand greater than the ordered goods. The second plot shows the reward function \\(r(a,\\cdot)\\), which depends on the value of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n\nThe plot of \\(J(a)\\) is concave. This suggests that we can use calculus to find the optimal value. In particular, to find the optimal action, we need to compute the \\(a\\) such that \\(dJ(a)/da = 0\\). We first recall the Leibniz integral rule: \\[ \\dfrac{d}{dx} \\left( \\int_{p(x)}^{q(x)} f(x,t) dt \\right)\n   = f(x, q(x)) \\cdot \\dfrac {d}{dx} q(x)\n   - f(x, p(x)) \\cdot \\dfrac {d}{dx} p(x)\n   + \\int_{p(x)}^{q(x)} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,t) dt.\n\\]\nThus, the derivative of the first term of \\eqref{eq:J} is \\[ [q a - p a ] f(a) + \\int_{0}^a [ -p ] f(w) dw\n= [q a - p a ] f(a) - p F(a).\n\\]\nSimilarly, the derivative of the second term of \\eqref{eq:J} is \\[ - [q a - p a] f(a) + \\int_{a}^{\\infty} (q-p)f(w)dw\n= - [q a - p a] f(a) + (q -p)[ 1 - F(a)].\n\\]\nCombining the two, we get that \\[ \\dfrac{dJ(a)}{da} = - p F(a) + (q - p) [ 1 - F(a) ]. \\]\nEquating this to \\(0\\), we get \\[ F(a) = \\dfrac{ q - p }{ q}\n\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\na = F^{-1} \\left( \\dfrac{ q - p }{ q } \\right).\n\\] In the literature, the quantity \\((q-p)/q\\) is called the critical fractile.\nAn illustration of the optimal decision rule is shown below/on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4The value of optimal action for different values of \\(p\\). The optimal action is such that the area of the red shaded region in the curve equals the critical factile value \\((q - p)/q\\).  In this example, it is assumed that \\(W\\) is distributed according to Kumaraswamy distribution with parameters \\((a,b) = (2,5)\\) and support \\([0,100]\\). The value of \\(q=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, we also need to verify that the function \\(J(a)\\) is concave. To do so, we compute the second derivative: \\[\n  \\frac{d^2 J(a)}{da^2} = - p f(a) - (q - p) f(a) = -q f(a) \\le 0.\n\\] Hence, the \\(J(a)\\) is concave and the extremum value computed above is a maximum.\n\n\n\nNow, we come back to the problem with discrete actions and discrete demand. Suppose \\(W\\) takes the values \\(\\ALPHABET W = \\{ w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_k \\}\\) (where \\(w_1 < w_2 < \\cdots < w_k\\)) with probabilities \\(\\{ μ_1, μ_2, \\dots, μ_k \\}\\). It is ease to see that in this case the action \\(a\\) should be in the set \\(\\{ w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_k \\}\\).\nAs an illustration, consider the case when \\(\\ALPHABET W = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 100\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 The value of expected cost as a function of action. This is similar to Figure 1, except that demand and actions can take discrete values.\n\n\n\nIn the discrete case, the brute force search is easier (because there are a finite rather than continuous number of values). We cannot directly use the ideas from calculus because functions over discrete domain are not differentiable. But we can use a very similar idea. Instead of checking if \\(dJ(a)/da = 0\\), we check the sign of \\(J(w_{i+1}) - J(w_i)\\).\nThe expected reward for choice \\(w_i\\) is \\[ \\begin{align*} J(w_i) &=\n\\sum_{j < i} μ_j [ q w_j - p w_i ] + \\sum_{j \\ge i} μ_j [q w_i - p w_i]\n\\\\\n&= -p w_i + q \\Bigl[ \\sum_{j < i}  μ_j w_j + \\sum_{j \\ge i} μ_j w_i \\Bigr].\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, \\[ \\begin{align*}\n  J(w_{i+1}) - J(w_i) &=\n  -p w_{i+1} + q \\Bigl[ \\sum_{j < i+1}  μ_j w_j + \\sum_{j \\ge i+1} μ_j w_{i+1} \\Bigr]\n  \\\\\n  &\\quad + p w_i - q \\Bigl[ \\sum_{j < i}  μ_j w_j + \\sum_{j \\ge i} μ_j w_i \\Bigr]\n  \\\\\n  &= -p (w_{i+1} - w_i) + q \\Bigl[ \\sum_{j \\ge i + 1} μ_j ( w_{i+1} - w_i) \\Bigr]\n  \\\\\n  &= \\big( - p + q [ 1 - M_i ] \\big) (w_{i+1} - w_i),\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(M_i\\) is the cumulative probability mass function. Note that \\[\nM_i \\le \\dfrac{q-p}{q}\n\\iff\n-p + q [ 1 - M_i ] \\ge 0.\n\\] Thus, for all \\(i\\) such that \\(M_i \\le (q-p)/q\\), \\(J(w_{i+1}) \\ge J(w_i)\\). On the other hand, for all \\(i\\) such that \\(M_i > (q-p)/q)\\), \\(J(w_{i+1}) < J(w_i)\\). Thus, the optimal amount to order is the largest \\(w_i\\) such that \\(M_i \\le (q-p)/q\\).\nNote that the structure of the optimal solution is the same for continuous and discrete demand distributions.\n\nExercises\n\nQualitative properties of optimal solution. The numerical results shown in Figure 4 suggest that, for a fixed value of \\(q\\), the optimal value of \\(a\\) is a decreasing function of \\(p\\). Intuitively, this makes sense: if the purchase price of the newspaper increases, but the selling price remains the same, then the newsvendor should buy less newspapers. Formally prove this statement.\nHint: The CDF of a distribution is a weakly increasing function.\nMonotonicity of optimal action. Consider two scenarios for the case with continuous demand and actions. In scenario 1, the demand is distributed according to PDF \\(f_1\\). In scenario 2, it is distributed according to PDF \\(f_2\\). Suppose \\(F_1(w) \\le F_2(w)\\) for all \\(w\\). Show that the optimal action \\(a_1\\) for scenario 1 is greater than the optimal action \\(a_2\\) for scenario 2.\nHint: Plot the two CDFs and try to interpret the optimal decision rule graphically.\nSelling random wind. The amount \\(W\\) of power generated by the wind turbine is a positive real-valued random variable with probability density function \\(f\\). The operator of the wind turbine has to commit to provide a certain amount of power in the day-ahead market. The price of power is \\(\\$p\\) per MW.\nIf the operator commits to provide \\(a\\) MW of power and the wind generation \\(W\\) is less than \\(a\\), then he has to buy the balance \\(a - W\\) from a reserves market at the cost of \\(\\$ q\\) per unit, where \\(q > p\\). Thus, the reward of the operator is \\(r(a,W)\\) where \\[ r(a, w) = \\begin{cases}\n   p a, & \\text{if } w > a \\\\\n   p a - q (a  - w), & \\text{if } w < a.\n\\end{cases}\\]\nFind the value of commitment \\(a\\) that maximizes the expected reward.\n\n\n\nNotes\nPerhaps the earliest model of the newsvendor problem appeared in Edgeworth (1888) in the context of a bank setting the level of cash reserves to cover demands from its customers. The solution to the basic model presented above and some of its variants was provided in Morse and Kimball (1951); Arrow et al. (1952); Whitin (1953). See Porteus (2008) for an accessible introduction.\nThe property \\(F_1(w) \\le F_2(w)\\) used in Exercise 2 is called stochastic dominance. Later in the course, we will study how stochastic dominance is useful to establish monotonicity properties of general MDPs.\nThe example of selling random wind in Exercise 3 is taken from Bitar et al. (2012).\n\n\n\n\nArrow, K.J., Harris, T., and Marschak, J. 1952. Optimal inventory policy. Econometrica 20, 1, 250–272.
