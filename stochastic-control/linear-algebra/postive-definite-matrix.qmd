## Definite and basic properties

:::{#def-positive-definite}

A $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $M$ is called

* _positive definite_ (written as $M > 0$) if for all $x \in
  \reals^n$, $x \neq 0$, we have
  $$x^\TRANS M x > 0.$$ 

* _positive semi definite_ (written as $M \ge 0$) if for all $x \in
  \reals^n$, $x \neq 0$, we have
  $$x^\TRANS M x \ge 0.$$ 

:::

### Examples {-}

* $\MATRIX{ x_1 & x_2 } \MATRIX{ 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 } \MATRIX{ x_1 \\ x_2 }
= 3 x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2$. 

  Thus, $\MATRIX{ 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 } > 0$. 

* $\MATRIX{ x_1 & x_2 } \MATRIX{ 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 } \MATRIX{ x_1 \\ x_2 }
=  2 x_2^2$. 

  Thus, $\MATRIX{ 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 } \ge 0$. 

## Remarks on positive definite matrices

1. By making particular choices of $x$ in the definition of positive definite
   matrix, we have that for a positive definite matrix $M$, 

   * $M_{ii} > 0$ for all $i$
   * $M_{ij} < \sqrt{M_{ii} M_{jj}}$ for all $i \neq j$.

   However, satisfying these inequalities is not sufficient for positive
   definiteness. 

2. A symmetric matrix is positive definite (respt. postive semi-definite) if
   and only if all of its eigenvalues are positive (respt. non-negative).

3. Therefore, a sufficient condition for a symmetric matrix to be positive
   definite is that all diagonal elements are positive and the matrix is
   diagonally dominant, i.e., $M_{ii} > \sum_{j \neq i} | M_{ij}|$ for all {-}
   $i$.

4. If $M$ is symmetric positive definite, then so is $M^{-1}$.

5. If $M$ is symmetric positive definite, then $M$ has a unique symmetric positive
   definite square root $R$ (i.e., $RR = M$).

6. If $M$ is symmetric positive definite, then $M$ has a unique Cholesky
   factorization $M = T^\TRANS T$, where $T$ is upper triangular with positive
   diagonal elements. 

4. The set of positive semi-definite matrices forms a convex cone. 

5. Positive definiteness introduces a partial order on the convex cone of
   positive semi-definite matrices. In particular, we say that for two
   positive semi-definite matrices $M$ and $N$ of the same dimension, $M
   \succeq N$ if $M - N$ is positive semi-definite. For this reason, often $M
   \succ 0$ and $M \succeq 0$ is used a short-hand to denote that $M$ is
   positive definite and positive semi-definite.

6. Let $M$ is a symmetric square matrix. Let 
   $$ λ_1(M) \ge λ_2(M) \ge \dots \ge λ_n(M) $$
   denote the ordered (real) eigenvalues of $M$. Then
   $$ λ_1(M)I \succeq M \succeq λ_n(M)I. $$

7. If $M \succeq N$, then
   $$ λ_k(M) \ge λ_k(N), \quad k \in \{1, \dots, n\}. $$

8. If $M \succeq N \succ 0$, then
   $$ N^{-1} \succeq M^{-1} \succ 0. $$

9. If $M \succeq N$ are $n × n$ matrices and $T$ is a $m × n$ matrix, then
   $$ T^\TRANS M T \succeq T^\TRANS N T. $$

10. If $M, N$ are $n×$ positive semi-definite matrices, then
   $$ \sum_{i=1}^k λ_i(M) λ_{n-i+1}(N) \le
      \sum_{i=1}^k λ_i(MN) \le
      \sum_{i=1}^k λ_i(M)λ_i(N), 
      \quad k \in \{1, \dots, n\}.
   $$
   Note that this property does not require $M - N$ to be positive or negative
   semi-definite. 

11. If $M \succ 0$ and $T$  are square matrices of the same size, then
   $$ TMT + M^{-1} \succeq 2T. $$

## A useful relationship.

Symmetric block matrices of the form

$$ C = \MATRIX{ A & X \\ X^\TRANS & B } $$

often appear in applications. If $A$ is non-singular, we can write

$$
\MATRIX{A & X \\ X^\TRANS & B } = 
\MATRIX{I & 0 \\ X^\TRANS A^{-1} & I}
\MATRIX{A & 0 \\ 0 & B - X^\TRANS A^{-1} X }
\MATRIX{I & A^{-1} X \\ 0 & I }
$$
which shows that $C$ is congruent to a block diagonal matrix, which is
positive definite when its diagonal blocks are postive definite. Therefore,
$C$ is positive definite if and only if both $A$ and $B - X^\TRANS A^{-1} X$
are positive definite. The matrix $B = X^\TRANS A^{-1} X$ is called the Shur
complement of $A$ in $C$. 

## Determinant bounds

:::{#prp-fischer-inequality}
### Fischer's inequality

Suppose $A$ and $C$ are positive semidefinite matrix and 
$$ M = \MATRIX{A & B \\ B^\TRANS & C}. $$
Then
$$ \det(M) \le \det(A) \det(C). $$
:::

Recursive application of Fischer's inequality gives the Hadamard's inequality
for a symmetric positive definite matrix:
$$ \det(A) \le A_{11} A_{22} \cdots A_{nn}, $$
with equality if and only if $A$ is diagonal. 

:::{#prp-PD-ratio}
If $M \succ N \succ 0$ are $n × n$ matrices and $T$ is a $m × n$
matrix, then
$$ \sup_{ T \neq 0} \frac{ \| T^\TRANS M T \| }{ \| T^\TRANS N T \|} 
   \le \frac{ \det(M) }{ \det(N) }, $$
where for any matrix $M$, 
$$
  \| M \| = \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{ \| M x \|_2 }{ \|x\|_2 }
$$
is the $2$-norm of the matrix.

## References {-}

The properties of positive definite matrices are stated in any book
on the theory of matrices. See for example @Marshall2011.

Historically, a matrix used as a test matrix for testing positive definiteness
was the Wilson matrix
$$ W = \MATRIX{5 & 7 & 6 & 5 \\ 7 & 10 & 8 & 7 \\ 6 & 8 & 10 & 9 \\ 5 & 7 & 9
& 10}. $$
