Throughout this section, we assume that $\ALPHABET S$ and $\ALPHABET A$ are finite and $|\ALPHABET S|= n$ and $|\ALPHABET A| = m$. 

We know that if $V \le \mathcal B V$ then $V \le V^* = \mathcal B V^*$. Thus,
$V^*$ is the "largest" $V$ that satisfies the constraint $V \le \mathcal B V$.
This constraint can be written as a finite system of linear equations:
$$\begin{equation} \label{eq:constaints}
V(s) \le c(s,a) + γ\sum_{z \in \ALPHABET S} P(z|s,a) V(z), 
\qquad s \in \ALPHABET S, a \in \ALPHABET A.
\end{equation}$$
This observation provides the basis for a linear programming formulation of
the discounted MDP. 

### Primal Linear Program {-}

Choose a weight function $p \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals_{\ge 0}$ such that
$\sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} p(s) = 1$. This can be thought of as the
distribution of the initial state. Then the primal LP corresponding to
\\eqref{eq:constaints} is
$$\begin{gather}
  \max \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} p(s) V(s) \notag \\
  \text{subject to}\quad
  V(s) - γ \sum_{z \in \ALPHABET S} P(z|s,a)V(z) \le c(s,a), 
  \quad \forall s \in \ALPHABET S, a \in \ALPHABET A.
  \label{eq:primal}
\end{gather}$$

### Dual Linear Program {-}

Now consider the dual version of the primal LP \\eqref{eq:primal}. We
associate a positive dual variable $\mu(s,a)$ for each constraint consider the
following linear program:[^1]
$$\begin{gather}
  \min \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \mu(s,a) c(s,a)
  \notag \\
  \text{subject to}\quad
  \mu(s,a) - γ\sum_{z \in \ALPHABET S} \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A}
  P(s | z, a) \mu(z,a) = p(s), \quad \forall s \in \ALPHABET S, \notag \\
  \mu(s,a) \ge 0, \quad \forall s \in \ALPHABET S, a \in \ALPHABET A. 
  \label{eq:dual}
\end{gather}$$

[^1]: [Wikipedia] has a decent description of how to construct a dual LP from
  a primal LP. I find the explanation in [Sebastien Lahaie's notes][LP] to be
  more illuminating.

The primal LP has $n$ variables ($V(1), V(2), \dots, V(n)$) and $n \times m$
constraints, while the dual LP has $n \times m$ variables. So, in general, the
dual is more efficient to solve. 

### Basic solution and stationary policies {-}

We state the following results without proof. See @Puterman2014 [Sec 6.9] for
details. 

1. Let $π$ be any possibly randomized history dependent policy. Define the
   _occupancy measure_
    
    $$\mu_π(s,a) = \sum_{z \in \ALPHABET S} p(z) 
    \sum_{t=1}^\infty γ^{t-1} \PR^{π}(S_t = s, A_t = a \mid S_1 = z).$$

    Then, $\mu_π$ is a feasible solution to the dual LP \\eqref{eq:dual}.

2. Suppose $\mu(s,a)$ is a feasible solution to the dual LP. Then for each $s
   \in \ALPHABET S$ such that $\sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \mu(s,a) > 0$, define
   a stationary randomized policy $h$ by
   $$\begin{equation} \label{eq:policy}
   h(a|s) h_\mu(a|s) = \frac{ \mu(s,a) } { \displaystyle \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \mu(s,a) }. 
   \end{equation} $$
   Then, $\mu_h$ is a feasible solution to the dual LP and $\mu_h(s,a) =
   \mu(s,a)$ for all $s \in \ALPHABET S$ and $a \in \ALPHABET A$. 

3. A feasible solution of an LP is called a _basic feasible solution_ if it
   cannot be expression as a nontrivial convex combination of other feasible
   solutions. A key property of a basic feasible solution is that when the LP
   has $k$ constraints, then all basic feasible solutions have at most $k$
   positive components. Using this, one can show that if $\mu$ is a basic
   feasible solution, then the policy $h$ given by \\eqref{eq:policy} is a
   deterministic policy.

4. Similarly, for any deterministic policy $h$, the occupancy measure $\mu_h$
   is a basic feasible solution to the dual LP. 


5. If $\mu^*$ is an _optimal_ solution to the dual LP, then $h_{\mu}$ is an
   optimal policy. 

6. If $\mu^*$ is an _optimal basic_ solution to the dual LP, then $h_{\mu}$ is
   a deterministic optimal policy.

7. If $h$ is a possibly randomized optimal policy for the MDP, them $\mu_h$ is
   a optimal solution to the dual LP.

8. If $h$ is a deterministic optimal policy for the MDP, then $\mu_h$ is a
   optimal basic solution to the dual LP. 

9. As long as $p(s) > 0$ for all $s$, the policy $h_\mu$ based of optimal
   solution the dual LP does not depend on $p(s)$. This means that $p(s)$
   need not sum to 1. 

There are various trade-offs between solving a DP using value iteration,
policy iteration, and LP and we will not go into these trade-offs here. But
one benefit of the LP formulation is that it is easy to add constraints, which
we discuss next.

## Constrained MDPs

Suppose, in addition to the per-step cost function $c \colon \ALPHABET S
\times \ALPHABET A \to \reals$, we have a per-step constraint function $d
\colon \ALPHABET S \times \ALPHABET A \to \reals$ and we are interested in the
following constrained optimization problems:

$$\begin{gather*}
\min \EXP\Bigl[ \sum_{t=1}^\infty γ^{t-1} c(S_t, A_t) \Bigr] \\
\text{subject to}\quad
\EXP\Bigl[ \sum_{t=1}^\infty γ^{t-1} d(S_t, A_t) \Bigr] \le D. 
\end{gather*}$$

The dual LP in this case is given by 
$$\begin{gather}
  \min \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \mu(s,a) c(s,a)
  \notag \\
  \text{subject to}\quad
  \mu(s,a) - γ\sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A}
  P(s | z, a) \mu(s,a) = p(s), \quad \forall s \in \ALPHABET S, \notag \\
  \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} \sum_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \mu(s,a) d(s,a) \le D \notag \\
  \mu(s,a) \ge 0, \quad \forall s \in \ALPHABET S, a \in \ALPHABET A. 
\end{gather}$$

If we interpret $\mu(s,a)$ as the occupation measure of any policy, then this
formulation follows immediately.
