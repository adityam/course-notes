In many applications, it is useful to know if the value function and the optimal policy is weakly increasing (or weakly decreasing) in state. Sufficient conditions are presented under which such monotonicity properties hold. These properties are useful because they makes it easy to search and implement the optimal policy.

## Stochastic dominance

[Stochastic dominance is a partial order on random variables defined on totally ordered sets]{.aside}
Let $\ALPHABET S$ be a totally ordered finite set, say $\{1, \dots, n\}$. 

:::{.callout-note}
### (First order) stochastic dominance
Suppose $S^1$ and $S^2$ are $\ALPHABET S$ valued random variables where $S^1 \sim \mu^1$ and $S^2 \sim \mu^2$. We say $S^1$ _stochastically dominates_ $S^2$ if for any $s \in \ALPHABET S$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inc-prob}
  \PR(S^1 \ge s) \ge \PR(S^2 \ge s). 
\end{equation}

Stochastic domination is denoted by $S^1 \succeq_s S^2$ or $\mu^1 \succeq_s \mu^2$. 
:::

Let ${\rm M}^1$ and ${\rm M}^2$ denote the CDF of $\mu^1$ and $\mu^2$. Then
\\eqref{eq:inc-prob} is equivalent to the following:
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:cdf}
  {\rm M}^1_s \le {\rm M}^2_s, \quad \forall s \in \ALPHABET S.
\end{equation}$$
Thus, visually, $S^1 \succeq_s S^2$ means that the CDF of $S^1$ _lies below_
the CDF of $S^2$. 

:::{.callout-tip}
### Example
$\left[0, \frac 14, \frac 14, \frac 12\right]
\succeq_s
\left[\frac 14, 0, \frac 14, \frac 12 \right]
\succeq_s
\left[\frac 14, \frac 14, \frac 14, \frac 14 \right].$
:::

Stochastic dominance is important due to the following property.

:::{#thm-stochastic-dominance}
Let $f \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals$ be a (weakly) increasing function and $S^1 \sim \mu^1$ and $S^2 \sim \mu^2$ are random variables defined on $\ALPHABET S$. Then $S^1 \succeq_s S^2$ if and only if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inc-fun}
  \EXP[f(S^1)] \ge \EXP[f(S^2)]. 
\end{equation}
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof (stochastic dominance implies monotone expectations)
For the ease of notation, let $f_i$ to denote $f(i)$ and define ${\rm M}^1_0 = {\rm M}^2_0 = 0$. Consider the following:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^n f_i \mu^1_i 
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n f_i ({\rm M}^1_i - {\rm M}^1_{i-1})
    \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n {\rm M}^1_{i-1} (f_{i-1} - f_{i}) + f_n {\rm M}^1_n
    \\
    &\stackrel{(a)}{\ge}
    \sum_{i=1}^n {\rm M}^2_{i-1} (f_{i-1} - f_{i}) + f_n {\rm M}^2_n
    \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n f_i ({\rm M}^2_i - {\rm M}^2_{i-1})
    \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n f_i \mu_i, 
\end{align*}
which completes the proof. In the above equations, $(a)$ uses the following facts:

1. For any $i$, ${\rm M}^1_{i-1} \le {\rm M}^2_{i-1}$ (because of \\eqref{eq:cdf}) and
   $f_{i-1} - f_{i} < 0$ (because $f$ is increasing function). Thus,
   $${\rm M}^1_{i-1}(f_{i-1} - f_i) \ge {\rm M}^2_{i-1}(f_{i-1} - f_i). $$
2. ${\rm M}^1_n = {\rm M}^2_n = 1$. 
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof (monotone expectations implies stochastic monotonicity)
Suppose for any increasing function $f$, \\eqref{eq:inc-fun} holds. Given any $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, define the function $f_i(k) = \IND\{k > i\}$, which is an increasing function of $k$. Then,
$$ \EXP[f_i(S)] = \sum_{k=1}^n f_i(k) \mu^1_k = \sum_{k > i} \mu^1_k = 1 - {\rm M}^1_i.
$$
By a similar argument, we have
$$ \EXP[f_i(S^2)] = 1 - {\rm M}^2_i. $$
Since $\EXP[f_i(S)] \ge \EXP[f_i(S^2)]$, we have that ${\rm M}^1_i \le {\rm M}^2_i$. 
:::

## Stochastic monotonicity

Stochastic monotonicity extends the notion of stochastic dominance to Markov chains. Suppose $\ALPHABET S$ is a totally ordered set and $\{S_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain on $\ALPHABET S$ with transition probability matrix $P$. Let $P_i$ denote the $i$-th row of $P$. Note that $P_i$ is a PMF. 

:::{.callout-tip}
### Stochastic monotonicity
A Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ is stochastically monotone if 
$$ P_i \succeq_s P_j, \quad \forall i > j. $$
:::

An immediate implication is the following.

:::{#thm-stochastic-monotonicity}
Let $\{S_t\}_{t \ge 1}$ be a Markov chain with transition matrix $P$ and $f \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals$ is a weakly increasing function. Then, for any $s^1, s^2 \in \ALPHABET S$ such that $s^1 > s^2$, 
$$ \EXP[f(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s^1] \ge \EXP[ f(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s^2], $$
if and only if $P$ is stochatically monotone.
:::

## Monotonicity of value functions

::: {#thm-monotone-value}
Consider an MDP where the state space $\ALPHABET S$ is totally ordered. Suppose the following conditions are satisfied.

C1. For every $a \in \ALPHABET A$, the per-step cost $c_t(s,a)$ is weakly inceasing in $s$.

C2. For every $a \in \ALPHABET A$, the transition matrix $P(a)$ is stochastically monotone. 

Then, the value function $V_t(s)$ is weakly increasing in $s$.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
### Note
The result above also applies to models with continuous (and totally ordered) state space provided the measurable selection conditions hold so that the arg min at each step of the dynamic program is attained. 
:::


:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
We proceed by backward induction. By definition, $V_{T+1}(s) = 0$, which is
weakly increasing. This forms the basis of induction. Assume that
$V_{t+1}(s)$ is weakly increasing. Now consider,
$$Q_t(s,a) = c_t(s,a) + \EXP[V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s, A_t = a].$$
For any  $a \in \ALPHABET A$, $Q_t(s,a)$ is a sum of two weakly increasing
functions in $s$; hence $Q_t(s,a)$ is weakly increasing in $s$. 

Now consider $s_1, s_2 \in \ALPHABET S$ such that $s_1 > s_2$. Suppose $a_1^*$ is the optimal action at state $s_1$. Then
$$ 
  V_t(s^1) = Q_t(s^1, a_1^*) \stackrel{(a)}\ge Q_t(s^2,a_1^*) \stackrel{(b)}\ge V_t(s_2),
$$
where $(a)$ follows because $Q_t(\cdot, u^*)$ is weakly increasing and $(b)$
follows from the definition of the value function.

## Submodularity

:::{.callout-note}
### Submodularity
Let $\ALPHABET X$ and $\ALPHABET Y$ be partially ordered sets. A function $f \colon \ALPHABET X \times \ALPHABET Y \to \reals$ is called _submodular_ if for any $x^+ \ge x^-$ and $y^+ \ge y^-$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:submodular}
  f(x^+, y^+) + f(x^-, y^-) \le f(x^+, y^-) + f(x^-, y^+).
\end{equation}

The function is called _supermodular_ if the inequality in \\eqref{eq:submodular} is reversed. 
:::

A continuous and differentiable function on $\reals^2$ is submodular iff
$$ \frac{ \partial^2 f(x,y) }{ \partial x \partial y } \le 0,
  \quad \forall x,y. 
$$
If the inequality is reversed, then the function is supermodular. 

Submodularity is a useful property because it implies monotonicity of the arg
min.

::: {#thm-submodular}

Let $\ALPHABET X$ be a partially ordered set,  $\ALPHABET Y$ be a totally ordered set, and $f \colon \ALPHABET X \times \ALPHABET Y \to \reals$ be a _submodular_ function. Suppose that for all $x$, $\arg \min_{y \in \ALPHABET Y} f(x,y)$ exists. Then,
$$
  π(x) := \max \{ y^* \in \arg \min_{y \in \ALPHABET Y} f(x,y) \}
$$
is weakly _increasing_ in $x$.
::: 

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
Consider $x^+, x^- \in \ALPHABET X$ such that $x^+ \ge x^-$. Since $f$ is submodular, for any $y \le π(x^-)$, we have
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
  f(x^+, π(x^-)) - f(x^+, y) \le f(x^-, π(x^-)) - f(x^-, y) \le 0,
\end{equation}$$
where the last inequality follows because $π(x^-)$ is the arg min of $f(x^-, y)$. Eq. \\eqref{eq:1} implies that for all $y \le π(x^-)$, 
$$ 
  f(x^+, π(x^-)) \le f(x^+, y).
$$
Thus, $π(x^+) \ge π(x^-)$.
:::

The analogue of @thm-submodular for supermodular functions is as follows. 

:::{#thm-supermodular}
Let $\ALPHABET X$ be a partially ordered set,  $\ALPHABET Y$ be a totally ordered set, and $f \colon \ALPHABET X \times \ALPHABET Y \to \reals$ be a _supermodular_ function. Suppose that for all $x$, $\arg \min_{y \in \ALPHABET Y} f(x,y)$ exists. Then,
$$
  π(x) := \min \{ y^* \in \arg \min_{y \in \ALPHABET Y} f(x,y) \}
$$
is weakly _decreasing_ in $x$.
::: 

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
The proof is similar to @thm-submodular.

Consider $x^+, x^- \in \ALPHABET X$ such that $x^+ \ge x^-$. Since $f$ is
supermodular, for any $y \ge π(x^-)$, we have
$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
  f(x^+, y) - f(x^+, π(x^-)) \ge f(x^-, y) - f(x^-, π(x^-)) \ge 0,
\end{equation}$$
where the last inequality follows because $π(x^-)$ is the arg min of $f(x^-,
y)$. Eq. \\eqref{eq:2} implies that for all $y \ge π(x^-)$, 
$$ 
  f(x^+, y) \ge f(x^+, π(x^-)).
$$
Thus, $π(x^+) \le π(x^-)$.

## Monotonicity of optimal policy

:::{#thm-increasing-policy}
Consider an MDP where the state space $\ALPHABET S$ and the action space $\ALPHABET A$ are totally ordered. Suppose that, in addition to (C1) and (C2), the following condition is satisfied.

C3. For any weakly increasing function $v$,
$$ c_t(s,a) + \EXP[ v(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s, A_t = a]$$
is submodular in $(s,a)$.

Let $π^*_t(s) = \max\{ a^* \in \arg \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} Q_t(s,a) \}$. Then, $π^*(s)$ is weakly increasing in $s$.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
Conditions (C1) and (C2) imply that the value function $V_{t+1}(s)$ is weakly
increasing. Therefore, condition (C3) implies that $Q_t(s,a)$ is submodular in
$(s,a)$. Therefore, the arg min is weakly increasing in $x$
:::

It is difficult to verify condition (C3). The following conditions
are sufficient for (C3).

:::{#lem-sufficient-C3}
Consider an MDP with totally ordered state and action spaces. Suppose
    
(a) $c_t(s,a)$ is submodular in $(s,a)$.
(b) For all $s' \in \ALPHABET S$, 
    $H(s' | s,a) = 1 - \sum_{z \le s'} P_{sz}(a)$ is submodular in $(s,a)$.

The condition (C3) of the previous theorem holds.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
Consider $s^+, s^- \in \ALPHABET S$ and $a^+, a^- \in \ALPHABET A$ such that
$s^+ > s^-$ and $a^+ > a^-$. Define

$$\begin{align*}
  μ_1(s) &= \tfrac 12 P_{s^- s}(a^-) + \tfrac 12 P_{s^+ s}(a^+), \\
  μ_2(s) &= \tfrac 12 P_{s^- s}(a^+) + \tfrac 12 P_{s^+ s}(a^-).
\end{align*}$$
Since $H(s' | s,a)$ is submodular, we have
$$ H(s' | s^+, a^+) + H(s' | s^-, a^-) \le H(s' | s^+, a^-) + H(s' | s^-, a^+) $$
or equivalently,
$$\sum_{z \le s'} \big[ P_{s^+ z}(a^+) + P_{s^- z}(a^-) \big]
  \ge 
  \sum_{z \le s'} \big[ P_{s^+ z}(a^-) + P_{s^- z}(a^+) \big]. $$
which implies
$$ M_1(s') \ge M_2(s')$$
where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the CDFs of $μ_1$ and $μ_2$. Thus, $μ_1 \preceq_s
μ_2$.

Hence, for any weakly increasing function $v \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals$,
$$ \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} μ_1(s') v(s') \le 
   \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} μ_2(s') v(s').$$
Or, equivalently, 
$$H(s^+, a^+) + H(s^-, a^-) \le H(s^-, a^+) + H(s^+, a^-)$$
where $H(s,a) = \EXP[ v(X_{t+1}) | X_t = s, U_t = a]$. 

Therefore, $c_t(s,a) + H_t(s,a)$ is submodular in $(s,a)$. 
:::
   

The analogue of @thm-increasing-policy for supermodular functions is as follows.

:::{#thm-decreasing-policy}
Consider an MDP where the state space $\ALPHABET S$ and the action space $\ALPHABET A$ are totally ordered. Suppose that, in addition to (C1) and (C2), the following condition is satisfied.

C4. For any weakly increasing function $v$,
$$ c_t(s,a) + \EXP[ v(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s, A_t = a]$$
is supermodular in $(s,a)$.

Let $π^*_t(s) = \min\{ a^* \in \arg \min_{a \in \ALPHABET S} Q_t(s,a) \}$. Then, $π^*(s)$ is weakly decreasing in $s$.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
Conditions (C1) and (C2) imply that the value function $V_{t+1}(s)$ is weakly increasing. Therefore, condition (C4) implies that $Q_t(s,a)$ is supermodular in $(s,a)$. Therefore, the arg min is decreasing in $s$
:::

It is difficult to verify condition (C4). The following conditions are sufficient for (C4).

:::{#lem-sufficient-C4}
Consider an MDP with totally ordered state and action spaces. Suppose
    
(a) $c_t(s,a)$ is supermodular in $(s,a)$.
(b) For all $s' \in \ALPHABET S$, 
    $H(s' | s,a) = 1 - \sum_{z \le s'} P_{sz}(a)$ is supermodular in $(s,a)$.

The condition (C4) of the previous theorem holds.
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Proof 
Consider $s^+, s^- \in \ALPHABET S$ and $a^+, a^- \in \ALPHABET A$ such that $s^+ > s^-$ and $a^+ > a^-$. Define

$$\begin{align*}
  μ_1(s) &= \tfrac 12 P_{s^- s}(a^-) + \tfrac 12 P_{s^+ s}(a^+), \\
  μ_2(s) &= \tfrac 12 P_{s^- s}(a^+) + \tfrac 12 P_{s^+ s}(a^-).
\end{align*}$$
Since $H(s' | s,a)$ is supermodular, we have
$$ H(s' | s^+, a^+) + H(s' | s^-, a^-) \ge H(s' | s^+, a^-) + H(s' | s^-, a^+) $$
or equivalently,
$$\sum_{s' \le s'} \big[ P_{s^+ s'}(a^+) + P_{s^- s'}(a^-) \big]
  \le 
  \sum_{s' \le s'} \big[ P_{s^+ s'}(a^-) + P_{s^- s'}(a^+) \big]. $$
which implies
$$ M_1(s') \le M_2(s')$$
where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the CDFs of $μ_1$ and $μ_2$. Thus, $μ_1 \succeq_s
μ_2$.

Hence, for any weakly increasing function $v \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals$,
$$ \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} μ_1(s') v(s') \ge 
   \sum_{s' \in \ALPHABET S} μ_2(s') v(s').$$
Or, equivalently, 
$$H(s^+, a^+) + H(s^-, a^-) \ge H(s^-, a^+) + H(s^+, a^-)$$
where $H(s,a) = \EXP[ v(X_{t+1}) | X_t = s, U_t = a]$. 

Therefore, $c_t(s,a) + H_t(s,a)$ is supermodular in $(s,a)$. 
:::

## Constraints on actions

In the results above, we have assumed that the action set $\ALPHABET A$ is the
same for all states. The results also extend to the case when the action at
state $s$ must belong to some set $\ALPHABET A(s)$ provided the following
conditions are satisfied:

1.  For any $s \ge s'$, $\ALPHABET A(s) \supseteq \ALPHABET A(s')$
2.  For any $s \in \ALPHABET S$ and $a \in \ALPHABET A(s)$, $a' < a$ implies
    that $a' \in \ALPHABET A(s)$.

## Monotone dynamic programming

If we can establish that the optimal policy is monontone, then we can use this
structure to implement the dynamic program more efficient. Suppose 
$\ALPHABET S = \{1, \dots, n\}$ and $\ALPHABET A = \{1, \dots. m\}$. The main
idea is as follows. Suppose $V_{t+1}(\cdot)$ has been caclulated. Insead of
computing $Q_t(s,a)$ and $V_t(s)$, proceed as follows:

1. Set $s = 1$ and $α = 1$. 
2. For all $u \in \{α, \dots, m\}$, compute $Q_t(s,a)$ as usual. 
3. Compute 

     $$V_t(s) = \min_{ α \le a \le m } Q_t(s,a)$$

     and set 

     $$π_t^*(s) = \max \{ a \in \{α, \dots, m\} : V_t(s) = Q_t(s,a) \}.$$

4. If $s = n$, then stop. Otherwise, set $α = π_t^*(s)$ and $s = s+1$ and go
   to step 2. 

## Example: A machine replacement model

In this section, we use @thm-increasing-policy to establish the structure of
the optimal policy in a model of machine replacement. 

Consider a manufacturing process, where the machine used for manufacturing
deteriorates over time. Let $\ALPHABET S = \{0, 1, \dots \}$ represent the
condition of the machine. The higher the value of $s$, the worse the condition
of the equipment. Note that, for simplicity, we have assumed that the state
space is countable. 

At each decision epoch, the decision maker can choose
actions from the set $\ALPHABET A = \{0,1\}$. Action $0$ corresponds to
operating the equipment as is for an additional period, while action 1
corresponds to scrapping the equipment and replacing it with a new and
identical piece of equipment. We assume that there is a PMF $μ$ on $\ALPHABET
S$ such that 
$$ P_{sz}(0) = \begin{cases}
  0, & z < s \\
  μ_{z - s}, & z \ge s
\end{cases}
\quad\text{and}\quad
 P_sz(1) = μ_z.
$$
The transition matrix $P(0)$ states that the equipment detiorates from $s$ to
$s + k$, with probability $μ_k$ for all states $s$. 

We assume that running the machine in state $s$ costs $h(s)$, where $h(\cdot)$
is a weakly increasing function. Replacing the machine costs a constant
amount~$K$. 

We now verify the conditions (C1)--(C4) for the model. 

C1. For $a = 0$, $c(s,0) = h(s)$, which is weakly increasing by assumption.
For $a = 1$, $c(s,1) = K$, which is trivially weakly increasing.

C2. For $a = 0$, $P(0)$ is stochastically monotone (because the CDF of
$P(\cdot | s, 0)$ lies above the CDF of $P(\cdot | s+1, 0)$). For $a = 1$,
all rows of $P(1)$ are the same; therefore $P(1)$ is stochastically monotone. 

Since (C1) and (C2) are satisfied, by @thm-monotone-value, we can assert that the
value function is weakly increasing. 

C3. $c(s,1) - c(s,0) = K - h(s)$, which is weakly decreasing in $s$.
Therefore, $c(s,a)$ is submodular in $(s,a)$. 

C4. Recall that $H(s'|s,a) = 1 - \sum_{z \le s'} P_{sz}(a).$ Therefore, 
    
$$H(s'|s,0) = 1 - \sum_{z = s}^{s'} μ_{z -s} = 1 - \sum_{k = 0}^{s' - s} μ_k 
= 1 - M_{s' - s},$$
where $M$ is the CMF of $μ$, and
$$H(s'|s,1) = 1 - \sum_{z \le s'} μ_z = 1 - M_{s'},$$

Therefore, $H(s'|s,1) - H(s'|s,0) = M_{s'-s} - M_{s'}$. For any fixed $s'$,
$H(s'|s,1) - H(s'|s,0)$ is weakly decreasing in $s$. There $H(s'|s,a)$ is
submodular in $(s,a)$. 

Since (C1)--(C4) are satisfied, the optimal policy is weakly increasing
in~$s$. Since there are only two actions, it means that for every time, there
exists a state $s^*_t$ with the property that if $s$ exceeds $s^*_t$, the
optimal decision is to replace the machine; and if $s \le s^*_t$, then the
optimal decision is to operate the machine for another period.

(A1) For every $t$ and $a \in \ALPHABET A$, $c_t(s,a)$ is even
    function of $s$.

(A2) For every $a \in \ALPHABET A$, $P(a)$ is even.

Then, for all $t$, $V_t$ and $π_t$ are even functions.

b. Given any probability mass function $μ$ on $\ALPHABET S$, define the
_folded_ probability mass function $\tilde μ$ on $\ALPHABET X_{\ge 0}$ as
 follows:
 $$ \tilde μ(s) = \begin{cases}
      μ(0), & \text{if } s = 0 \\
      μ(s) + μ(-s), & \text{if } s > 0.
    \end{cases} $$

 For ease of notation, we use $\tilde μ = \mathcal F μ$ to denote this
 folding operation. Note that an immediate consequence of the definition
 is the following (you don't have to prove this).

:::{#lem-folded-sum}
If $f \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals$ is even, then for any probability
mass function $μ$ on $\ALPHABET S$ and $\tilde μ = \mathcal F μ$,
we have
$$
  \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} f(s) μ(s) = 
  \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET X_{\ge 0}} f(s) \tilde μ(s). $$
:::

 Thus, the expectation of the function $f \colon \ALPHABET S \to \reals$
 with respect to the PMF $μ$ is equal to the expectation of the
 function $f \colon \ALPHABET X_{\ge 0} \to \reals$ with respect to the
 PMF $\tilde μ = \mathcal F μ$. 

 Now given any probability transition matrix $P$ on $\ALPHABET S$, we can define a
 probability transition matrix $\tilde P$ on $\ALPHABET X_{\ge 0}$ as
 follows: for any $s \in \ALPHABET S$, $\tilde P_s = \mathcal F P_s$,
 where $P_s$ denotes the $s$-th row of $P$. For ease of notation, we use
 $\tilde P = \mathcal F P$ to denote this relationship. 

 Now prove the following:

:::{#prp-folded-monotonicity}
Given the MDP $(\ALPHABET S, \ALPHABET A, P, \{c_t\})$, define the
_folded_ MDP as $(\ALPHABET S_{\ge 0}, \ALPHABET A, \tilde P,
\{c_t\})$, where $\tilde P(a) = \mathcal F P(a)$ for all $a \in \ALPHABET
A$. Let $\tilde Q_t \colon \ALPHABET S_{\ge 0} \times \ALPHABET A \to
\reals$, $\tilde V_t \colon \ALPHABET S_{\ge 0} \to \reals$ and $\tilde
π_t^* \colon \ALPHABET S_{\ge 0} \to \ALPHABET A$ denote the
action-value function, value
function and the policy of the folded MDP. Then, if the original MDP
satisfies conditions (A1) and (A2) then, for any $s \in
\ALPHABET S$ and $a \in \ALPHABET A$, 
$$ Q_t(s,a) = \tilde Q_t(|s|, a),
\quad
  V_t(s) = \tilde V_t(|s|), 
\quad
  π_t^*(s) = \tilde π_t^*(|s|).
$$
::: 

c. The result of the previous part implies that if the value function
  $\tilde V_t$ and the policy $\tilde π^*_t$ are monotone increasing, then
  the value function $V_t$ and the policy $π^*_t$ are even and
  quasi-convex. This gives us a method to verify if the value function
  and optimal policy are even and quasi-convex.

    Now, recall the model of the Internet of Things presented in Q2 of 
    [Assignment 3](../../assignments/03). The numerical experiments that
    you did in Assignment 3 suggest that the value function and the
    optimal policy are even and quasi-convex. Prove that this is indeed
    the case. 

d. Now suppose the distribution of $W_t$ is not Gaussian but is some
   general probability density $\varphi(\cdot)$ and the cost function is
  $$ c(e,a) = \lambda a + (1 - a) d(e). $$
  Find conditions on $\varphi$ and $d$ such that the value function and
  optimal policy are even and quasi-convex.

## Notes {-}

Stochastic dominance has been employed in various areas of economics, finance, and statistics since the 1930s. See @Levy1992 and @Levy2015 for detailed overviews. The notion of stochastic monotonicity for Markov chains is due to @Daley1968. For a generalization of stochastic monotonicity to continuous state spaces, see @Serfozo1976. The characterization of stochastic monotonicity in @exr-sd-1--@exr-sd-4 are due to @Keilson1977.

@Ross1974 has an early treatment of monotonicity of optimal policies. The general theory was developed by @Topkis1998. The presentation here follows @Puterman2014. @exr-folded-monotonicity is from @Chakravorty2018.
