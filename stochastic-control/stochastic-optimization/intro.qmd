Let's start with the simplest optimization problem. A decision maker has to
choose an action $a \in \ALPHABET A$. Upon choosing the action $a$, the decision
maker incurs a cost $c(a)$. What action should the decision maker pick to
minimize the cost? 

Formally, the above optimization problem may be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:basic}
 \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} c(a).
\end{equation}

When the _action space_ $\ALPHABET A$ is finite, say $\ALPHABET A = \{1,
\dots, m\}$, solving the optimization problem \eqref{eq:basic} is conceptually straight-forward:
enumerate the cost of all possible actions, i.e., enumerate the set 
$C = \{ c(a) : a \in \ALPHABET A \}$ and find the smallest element. 

When the action space $\ALPHABET A$ is continuous, say a compact subset of a
Euclidean space, solving the optimization problem
\\eqref{eq:basic} is conceptually
straight-forward only when the cost function $c$ satisfies some regularity
conditions. For example, when $c$ is convex, the optimal action can be
obtained for solving 
$$ \dfrac {d c(a) }{ da } = 0. $$

In the absence of appropriate regularity conditions, it is not possible to
solve an optimization problem over continuous action spaces.

## The stochastic optimization problem

Now consider the simplest stochastic optimization problem. A decision maker
has to choose an action $a \in \ALPHABET A$. Upon choosing the action $a$, the
decision maker incurs a cost $c(a,W)$, where $W \in \ALPHABET W$ is a random
variable with known probability distribution. Assume that the decision maker
is _risk neutral_ and, therefore, wants to minimize $\EXP[ c(a, W) ]$, where
the expectation is with respect to the random variable $W$. 

Formally, the above optimization problem may be written as
$$\begin{equation} \label{eq:stochastic}
  \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \EXP[ c(a, W) ]. 
\end{equation}$$

Define $J(a) = \EXP[ c(a, W) ]$. Then
Problem \\eqref{eq:stochastic} is conceptually the same as
Problem \\eqref{eq:basic} with the cost function $J(a)$.
Numerically, Problem \\eqref{eq:stochastic} is more
difficult because computing $J(a)$ involves evaluating an expectation, but we
ignore the computational complexity for the time being. 

## Key simplifying idea

In the stochastic optimization problems considered above, the
decision maker does not observe any data before making a decision. In many
situations, the decision maker does observe some data, which is captured by
the following model. Suppose a decision maker observes a random variable $S
\in \ALPHABET S$ and then chooses an action $A \in \ALPHABET A$ as a function
of his observation according to a _decision rule_ $π$, i.e.,
$$ A = π(S). $$

Upon choosing the action $A$, the decision maker incurs a cost $c(S,A,W)$,
where $W \in \ALPHABET W$ is a random variable. We assume that the _primitive
random variables_ $(S,W)$ are defined on a common probability space and have a
known joint distribution. Assume that the decision maker is risk neutral and,
therefore, wants to minimize $\EXP[ c(S, π(S), W)]$, 
where the expectation is taken with respect to the joint probability
distribution of $(S,W)$. 

Formally, the above optimization problem may be written as
$$\begin{equation} \label{eq:obs} \tag{P1}
  \min_{π \colon \ALPHABET S \to \ALPHABET A} \EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ].
\end{equation}$$

Define $J(π) = \EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ]$. Then, Problem \\eqref{eq:obs} is
conceptually the same as Problem \\eqref{eq:basic} with one difference: In
Problem \\eqref{eq:basic}, the minimization is over a parameter $a$, while in
Problem \\eqref{eq:obs}, the minimization is over a function $π$. 

When $\ALPHABET S$ and $\ALPHABET A$ are finite sets, the optimal policy can
be obtained by an exhaustive search over all policies as follows: for each
policy $π$ compute the performance $J(π)$ and then pick the policy $π$ with
the smallest expected cost. 

Such an exhaustive search is not satisfying for two reasons. First, it has a
high computational cost. There are $| \ALPHABET A |^{| \ALPHABET S |}$
policies and, for each policy, we have to evaluate an expectation, which can
be expensive. Second, the above enumeration procedure does not work when
$\ALPHABET S$ or $\ALPHABET A$ are continuous sets.

There is an alternative way of viewing the problem that simplifies it
considerably. Instead of viewing the optimization problem before the system
starts running (i.e., the _ex ante_ view), imagine that the decision maker
waits until they see the realization $s$ of $S$ (i.e., the _interim view_).
they then asks what action $a$ should they take to minimize the expected
_conditional_ cost $Q(s,a) := \EXP[ c(s,a, W) | S = s]$, i.e., they consider
the problem

\begin{equation} \label{eq:cond-1} \tag{P2}
  \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \EXP[ c(s,a,W) | S = s], \quad
  \forall s \in \ALPHABET S.
\end{equation}

Thus, Problem \\eqref{eq:obs}, which is a functional optimization problem,
has been reduced to a collection of parameter optimization problems
(Problem \\eqref{eq:cond-1}), one for each possible of $s$. 

Now define
$$ \begin{equation} \label{eq:cond} \tag{P2-policy}
  π^∘(s) = \arg \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \EXP[ c(s,a, W) | S = s]
\end{equation} $$
where ties (in the minimization) are broken arbitrarily. 

::: {#thm-fact}
The decision rule $π^∘$ defined in \\eqref{eq:cond} is optimal for Problem \\ref{eq:basic}.

# Remark

We restricted the proof to finite $\ALPHABET S$, $\ALPHABET A$,
$\ALPHABET W$. This is to avoid any measurability issues. If
$\ALPHABET S$ and $\ALPHABET A$ are continuous sets, we need to restrict to
_measurable_ $π$ in Problem \\ref{eq:basic} (otherwise the expectation is not
well defined; of course the cost $c$ also has to be measurable). However, it
is not immediately obvious that $π^∘$ defined in \\eqref{eq:cond} is measurable.
Conditions that ensure this are known as _measurable selection theorems_.

# Proof
Let $π$ be any other decision rule. Then,
$$ \begin{align*}
  \EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ] &\stackrel{(a)}= \EXP[ \EXP[c(S, π(S), W) | S ] ] \\
  &\stackrel{(b)}\ge \EXP[\EXP[ c(S, π^∘(S), W) | S ] ] \\
  &\stackrel{(c)}= \EXP[ c(S, π^∘(S), W) ],
\end{align*} $$
where $(a)$ and $(c)$ follow from the law of iterated expectations and $(b)$
follows from the definition of $π^∘$ in \\eqref{eq:cond}. 
:::

We can also provide a partial converse of @thm-fact.

::: {#thm-converse}

If $\PR(S = s) > 0$ for all $s$, then any optimal policy $π^∘$ for
Problem \ref{eq:basic} must satisfy \eqref{eq:cond}.

:::

::::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Proof
We prove this by contradiction. Suppose $π^*$ is an optimal policy that does
not satisfy \\eqref{eq:cond}. 
By definition of $π^∘$, it must be the case that for all states
\begin{equation} 
   \EXP[ c(s, π^∘(s), W) | S = s ] 
   \le
   \EXP[ c(s, π^*(s), W) | S = s ] .
   \label{eq:ineq:1}
\end{equation}
Now, since $π^*$ does not satisfy \\eqref{eq:cond}, there exists some state $s^∘ \in \ALPHABET S$ such that 
\begin{equation}
   \EXP[ c(s^∘, π^*(s^∘), W) | S = s^∘ ] 
   > 
   \EXP[ c(s^∘, π^∘(s^∘), W) | S = s^∘ ] .
   \label{eq:ineq:2}
\end{equation}
Therefore, 
$$\begin{align*}
   \EXP[ c(S, π^*(S), W) ]
   &=
   \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} \PR(S = s) 
   \EXP[ \EXP[ c(s, π^*(s), W) | S = s ] ]
   \\
   & \stackrel{(a)}> 
   \sum_{s \in \ALPHABET S} \PR(S = s) 
   \EXP[ \EXP[ c(s, π^∘(s), W) | S = s ] ]
   \\
   &=
   \EXP[ c(S, π^∘(S), W) ]
\end{align*}$$
where $(a)$ follows from \\eqref{eq:ineq:1} and \\eqref{eq:ineq:2} and the
inequality is strict becase $\PR(S = s^∘) > 0$. Thus, $J(π^*) > J(π^∘)$ and,
hence, $π^*$ cannot be an optimal policy.

## Blackwell's principle of irrelevant information

In many scenarios, the decision maker may observe data which is irrelevant for
evaluating performance. In such instances, the decision maker may ignore such
information without affecting performance. Formally, we have the following
result, which is known as **Blackwell's principle of irrelevant information**.

::: {#thm-blackwell}
# Blackwell's principle of irrelevant information

Let $\ALPHABET S$, $\ALPHABET Y$, $\ALPHABET W$, and $\ALPHABET A$ be
standard Borel spaces and $S \in \ALPHABET S$, $Y \in \ALPHABET Y$, $W \in
\ALPHABET W$ be random variables defined on a common probability space.

A decision maker observes $(S,Y)$ and chooses $A = π(S,Y)$ to minimize
$\EXP[c(S,A,W)]$, where $c \colon \ALPHABET S \times \ALPHABET A \times
\ALPHABET W \to \reals$ is a measurable function.

**Then, if $W$ is conditionally independent of $Y$ given $S$, then
there is no loss of optimality in choosing $A$ only as a function
of $S$.**

Formally, there exists a $π^* \colon \ALPHABET S \to \ALPHABET A$ such
that for all $π \colon \ALPHABET S \times \ALPHABET Y \to \ALPHABET A$,
$$ \EXP[c(S, π^*(S), W)] \le \EXP[ c(S, π(S,Y), W) ]. $$
:::

::::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Proof
We prove the result for the case when $\ALPHABET S$, $\ALPHABET Y$, $\ALPHABET
W$, $\ALPHABET A$ are finite. 

Define $$π^*(s) = \arg \min_{a \in \ALPHABET A} \EXP[ c(s,a, W) | S = s]. $$
Then, by construction, for any $s \in \ALPHABET S$ and $a \in \ALPHABET A$, we
have that
$$ \EXP[ c(s, π^*(s), W ) | S = s]  \le \EXP[ c(s,a,W) | S = s]. $$
Hence, for any $π \colon \ALPHABET S \times \ALPHABET Y \to \ALPHABET A$, and
for any $s \in \ALPHABET S$ and $y \in \ALPHABET Y$, we have
$$ \begin{equation} \label{eq:opt}
  \EXP[ c(s, π^*(s), W) | S = s] \le \EXP[ c(s, π(s,y),W) | S = s]. 
\end{equation} $$
The result follows by taking the expectation of both sides of
\\eqref{eq:opt}.
::: 

The above proof doesn't work for general Borel spaces because $π^*$ defined
above may not exist (inf vs min) or may not be measurable. See @Blackwell1964
for a formal proof.

# Computing optimal policies

Suppose $\ALPHABET S = \{1, 2 \}$, $\ALPHABET A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, and $\ALPHABET
W = \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $(S,W)$ be random variables taking values in
$\ALPHABET S × \ALPHABET W$ with joint distribution $P$ shown below.

$$ P = \MATRIX{ 0.25 & 0.15 & 0.05  \\ 0.30 & 0.10 & 0.15 } $$

Here the row corresponds to the value of $s$ and the column corresponds to
the value of $w$. For example $\PR(S=2, W=1) = P_{21} = 0.30$. 

The cost function $c \colon \ALPHABET S \times \ALPHABET A \times \ALPHABET
W \to \reals$ is shown below

$$
c(\cdot,\cdot,1) = \MATRIX{3 & 5 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 }, \quad
c(\cdot,\cdot,2) = \MATRIX{4 & 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 8 }, \quad
c(\cdot,\cdot,3) = \MATRIX{1 & 2 & 2 \\ 4 & 1 & 3 }.
$$

Here the row corresponds to the value of $s$ and the column corresponds to
the value of $a$. For example $c(s=1,a=2,w=1) = 5$. 

Find the policy $π \colon \ALPHABET S \to \ALPHABET A$ that minimizes
$\EXP[ c(S, π(S), W) ]$.

# Blackwell's principle

Suppose $\ALPHABET S = \{1, 2\}$, $\ALPHABET Y = \{1, 2\}$, $\ALPHABET A =
\{1, 2, 3\}$, and $\ALPHABET W = \{1, 2, 3\}$. Let $(S,Y,W)$ be random
variables taking values in $\ALPHABET S × \ALPHABET Y × \ALPHABET W$, with
joint distribution $Q$ shown below.
$$
 Q_{Y = 1} = \MATRIX{0.15 & 0.10 & 0.00 \\ 0.15 & 0.05 & 0.10}
 \qquad
 Q_{Y = 2} = \MATRIX{0.10 & 0.05 & 0.05 \\ 0.15 & 0.05 & 0.05}
$$
For a fixed value of $y$, the row corresponds to the value of $s$ and the
column corresponds to the value of $w$. For example $\PR(S = 1, Y = 1, W =
3) = 0$.

The cost function $c \colon \ALPHABET S × \ALPHABET A × \ALPHABET W \to
\reals$ is the same as the previous exercise. 

a. Find the policy $π \colon \ALPHABET S × \ALPHABET Y \to \ALPHABET A$
   that  minimizes $\EXP[c(S, π(S,Y), W)]$. 

b. Compare the solution with the solution of the previous exercise in view
   of Blackwell's principle of irrelevant information. Clearly
   explain your observations.

::: {#exr-stoc-optim-pollution-monitoring}

# Pollution monitoring

Consider the problem of monitoring the pollution level of a river. The
river can have a high pollution level if there is a catastrophic failure
of a factory upstream. There are then two "pollution states" indicating
whether such a failure has not occured. We denote them by $S = 0$
(indicating no failure) and $S = 1$ (indicating catastrophic failure). Let
$[p, 1-p]$ denote the prior probability mass function of $S$. 

The pollution monitoring system has a sensor which takes a measurement $y$
of the pollution level. Let $f_s(y)$ denote the 
probabiity density of the observation $y$ conditional on the value of $s$,
$s \in \{0, 1\}$. Two actions are available at the monitoring system:
raise an alarm or not raise an alarm.
The cost of raising the alarm is $C_0$ if the state $S$ is $0$ or zero if
the state $S$ is $1$; the cost of not raising the alarm is zero if the
state $S$ is $0$ or $C_1$ if the state $S$ is $1$. 

Show that it is optimal to raise the alarm if
$$ p f_0(y) C_0 < (1 - p) f_1(y) C_1. $$
That is, it is optimal to raise the alarm if the _likelihood ratio_ $f_1(y)/f_0(y)$
exceeds the threshold value $p C_0/(1-p) C_1$.

@thm-blackwell is due to @Blackwell1964 in a short 2.5 page paper. A similar
result was used by @Witsenhausen1979 to show the structure of optimal coding
strategies in real-time communication. Also see the [blog post] by Maxim
Ragisnsky.

@exr-stoc-optim-pollution-monitoring is adaptive from @Whittle1996. It is a special instance of Bayesian
hypothesis testing problem. We will study a generalization of this model later
